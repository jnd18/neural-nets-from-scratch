# neural-nets-from-scratch
My own neural network library written from scratch in Python + NumPy. 

This "library" is really just [one small file](https://github.com/jnd18/neural-nets-from-scratch/blob/master/neuralnet.py)
that implements a basic computational graph language with reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

This code is meant as an exercise in understanding deep learning and automatic differentiation.

See the short [example notebook](https://github.com/jnd18/neural-nets-from-scratch/blob/master/example.ipynb) for a demo.
